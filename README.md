# TaskSwift

## Project Description

The TaskSwift is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It is designed to facilitate the management of interns by Mentors, Directors, and Superusers. The system allows authorized users to:

- Create and manage mentor, director, and superuser accounts.
- Add, edit, and view intern profiles.
- Assign mentors and directors to interns.
- Track and manage intern tasks and assignments.
- Monitor intern progress and performance.
- Generate reports and statistics on intern activities.

This system provides a centralized platform for efficient communication and coordination between mentors, directors, and interns, making intern management more streamlined and organized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the TaskSwift, ensure you have the following software and tools installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cdac-intern-management-system.git
   cd cdac-intern-management-system
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add necessary environment variables such as database connection URL, JWT secret, etc.

5. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the application in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified frontend port).
