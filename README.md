# TaskSwift

## Project Description

The TaskSwift is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It is designed to facilitate the management of interns by Mentors, Directors, and Superusers. The system allows authorized users to:

- Create and manage mentor, director, and superuser accounts.
- Add, edit, and view intern profiles.
- Assign mentors and directors to interns.
- Track and manage intern tasks and assignments.
- Monitor intern progress and performance.
- Generate reports and statistics on intern activities.

This system provides a centralized platform for efficient communication and coordination between mentors, directors, and interns, making intern management more streamlined and organized.
